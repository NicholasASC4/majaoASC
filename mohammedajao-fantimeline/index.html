                    Here came greatness, from the ashes of man's last will and testamant
                    to soothe the tortured ears coming from the poor rappers who claimed
                    to be supreme. A child, rivaled by none, who would reintroduce the
                    instrumental world of music and bring justice to shows around the world.
                    His name would be, Hiroyuki Sawano.
